A project-manager plugin. Requires the [Godot Global Project](https://github.com/dugramen/godot-global-project)

It adds a `temp-project` shortcut that opens an empty project every time, without saving the contents anywhere.

Perfect for quickly testing things, and for creating minimal reproduction projects (MRPs).

It also adds a `global-project` shortcut to open the global project.
